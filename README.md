Retail Shops Sales Analytics Dashboards (Power BI)
Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end business intelligence solution built using Power BI to analyse retail sales, commercial performance, and operational efficiency.
The dashboards are designed for different decision-makers, ensuring insights are not cluttered and each audience gets exactly what they need:
•	Executives → strategic overview
•	Commercial teams → pricing & promotions
•	Operations & People managers → performance execution
The focus is not just visuals, but decision-ready KPIs, clear narratives, and actionable insights.
